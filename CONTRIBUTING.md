1. Go through the [Issues](https://github.com/sflynlang/compiler/issues) to see if what you want is already in discussion. (**NOTE** If you are using **GitHub CLI** can run `gh issue view -R sflynlang/compiler`. [See more](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_view))

2. Open a new Issue if you do not find you need. Describe the bug, feature request, problems, additions you might want or anything clearly in the Issue message.

3. Mention in the Issue that you want to work on it.

4. Wait for the approval from the Maintainers of this project before starting to work on it.

5. Create a pull request after making the changes and mention the Issue number that your pull request is related to.

6. Make the required changes if the reviewer asks for them.

## How to work in this project if you are not a member

### 1. Fork the repository
First step is to fork this repository ([sflynlang/compiler](https://github.com/sflynlang/conpiler)) to your GitHub account. You can do this by clicking on the **Fork** button provided in the top right corner of the repository page.

> NOTE: If you are using **GitHub CLI** can run `gh repo fork sflynlang/compiler` to fork it. ([See more](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_fork))

Also, star and watch the repository to receive all the updates directly to your e-mail.

### 2. Clone the forked repository to your system
Clone the repository that you just forked into your account. Be careful to clone the forked repository (**your-username/compiler**) and not the main repository (**sflynlang/compiler**) as making direct changes to the main repository will result in conflict of code and lack of co-ordination as we proceed further.

The forked repository will have your username in the top left corner and the clone link will also contain your username (**https://github.com/your-username/compiler.git**).

> NOTE: If you are using **GitHub CLI** can run `gh repo clone your-username/compiler` to clone your forked repository. ([See more](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_clone))

### 3. Add the main repository as remote upstream
Now, you have the repository on your system and you are ready to make changes. But what if someone else changes the same thing that you just did?

To avoid any conflicts, you need to pull all the changes from the main repository.

So, after cloning the forked repository (**your-username/compiler**) to your system, use the command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sflynlang/compiler.git` to point to the main repository. You only need to do this once.

Now, after making any changes to your project on the system, follow these simple steps to push your work to the repository:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "feature/fix/refactor/docs: Commit message"` (Remember follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format)

`git pull upstream main` (This command checks for any conflicts with the main repository. Go through the conflicts and make changes, if required)

`git push origin main`

### 4. Read the official documentation
If you do not know **How to install our Rust Compiler** please read the [Official Documentation](https://github.com/sflynlang/docs).

### 5. Create a pull request
After pushing the changes to your forked repository (**your-username/compiler**), all you have to do is create a new pull request from your account by simply clicking on the **Pull Request** button.

> NOTE: If you are some commits behind of **sflynlang/compiler:main** then you need to first `git pull upstream main` from the system, push it to your forked repository and then create the **Pull Request**.

Give a detailed and useful explaination of what you did in the comments of your pull requests and someone from the maintainers or team leads will review the code and accept the pull request or ask you to change some things before merging it.

> NOTE: If you are using **GitHub CLI** can run `gh pr create --title "feature/fix: Title" --body "Pull request message"` or `gh pr create`. ([See more](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_create))

You can use our pull request template ([view here](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)).
